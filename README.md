## Lab Specific Tasks

### A Simple C Program
1. What are the specific types of comments that exist in the C programming language? Do some research, is there a third type that exists? If there is what is it and how is it used?

[Put answer here]

2. What is a compiler directive? When do they get used? 

[Put answer here]

3. Define the following compiler directives and when they are used: `#define`, `#if`, `#else`, `#endif`.

5. What is the `main()` function and why is it important in C programming?

[Put answer here]

6. What is a return value? Why are they used?

[Put answer here]

7. Why does the `main()` function have a return value? Where can you access the return value of the `main()` function?

8. Create a simple program in your lab repository on the Pi Z2W named `simple.c`. Your program should output something to the terminal and include all of the components found in this section. It must also include two different functions with different return value data types.

[Simple C Program](./simple.c)

9. Compile the program above in `gcc`. Make sure the executable is named `simple.bin` and that its assenbly code is available as well. You made need to do some aditional research to accomplish this. Remember: `man` and Google are your friends.

[Simple Assembly](./simple.s)
[Simple Binary](./simple.bin)
